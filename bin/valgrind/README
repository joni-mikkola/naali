Valgrind integration for naali
------------------------------

1. Introduction:
----------------

$path_to_naali/bin/ now contains valgrind.sh bash script which runs naali viewer under Valgrind.
Script uses two of the Valgrind profiler tools called memcheck and massif. Memcheck-tool finds
and analyses possible memory leaks and massif profiles naali heap-memory usage.

Purpose of this script is to help naali developers spot possible memory hogs/leaks in the code and
this way make naali more memory efficient and run better.

Valgrind.sh script is not meant to be 'make all do all' type of script. Purpose is that you make 
your own test scenario in javascript and give that file as parameter for valgrind.sh. This way 
you get test data meaningfull for your particular scenario. Make your script and place it in 
bin/valgrind/startupScripts/.

NOTICE: Running naali under Valgrind is extremely slow because every memory operation is analyzed 
by Valgrind. Therefore memcheck-tool runs ~100x slower than running standalone naali. Massif-tool
slows down naali by factor of ~50x. Running a test script which made two connections with naali
took circa 30 minutes to finish.

2. Valgrind related files:
--------------------------

bin/valgrind.sh: Main script to run tests under valgrind
bin/valgrind/logs/: Directory for valgrind produced log files.
bin/valgrind/supps/: Directory for valgrind memcheck-tool suppression files.
bin/valgrind/startupScripts/: Directory for test scenario javascripts.

3. Usage:
---------

To use valgrind test script you need valgrind installed on your system and build naali without optimizations.
All this is handled by setting 'valgrind_build'-variable to 'true' in tools/build-naali-deps.bash. When you have
done this and naali is built just run valgrind.sh script in bin/ directory:

./valgrind.sh <startupScript_path/filename>

There are few example startup scripts in bin/valgrind/startupScripts/.
