realXtend Tundra
===============

Introduction
------------
Tundra is a scriptable 3D internet application development platform. It is aimed primarily for application developers, as a platform for creating networked 3D worlds with customized content.

Tundra is based on Qt and Ogre3D.

System requirements
-------------------
-GPU with Shader Model 3.0 support
-(Windows only) Updated DirectX End-User Runtime from http://www.microsoft.com/directx

Getting Started
---------------
Tundra uses a traditional server-client architecture for networking. After installing, you can find two executables, server.exe and viewer.exe in the Tundra start menu.

The Tundra Server is used for standalone-mode editing and viewing Tundra documents. To host a 3D scene, run Tundra in dedicated mode using the --headless command line option. See http://www.realxtend.org/doxygen/runningnaali.html for details.

The Tundra Viewer is the client software that is used to connect to a server.
